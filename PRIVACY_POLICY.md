- **Draw Over Other Apps (Overlay):**  
  Used for the Focus Mode to show a blocking screen during selected time periods.

- **Battery Optimization Exemption:**  
  Required to allow Blockit to run uninterrupted in the background for real-time blocking.

  Used to display helpful reminders when blocking starts, ends, or focus mode is active.

  Websites are blocked using local filters. We do **not collect, store, or transmit** any URLs or browsing data.
